        My name is Adrianne Crouse. I’m a network support engineer for the <abbr title="Louisiana Optical Network Infrastrucutre">LONI</abbr>,
        <a href="http://www.loni.org">L O N I .org</a>, at LSU in Baton Rouge.
        I am also mom to a teen and a part time graduate student online.
        I completed a Masters in Information Technology earlier this year at Nova Southeastern,
        and I am in the Masters of Computer Information Services program at Boston University.
        I’ve been employed in network support roles since 1999, mostly with the LA state government offices of telecom and technology services.
        I‘ve been with LONI at LSU for 4 years. LONI is a network service provider affiliated with <a href="http://www.internet2.edu">internet2.edu</a>.
        I was blessed to start working with this group as plans were getting underway to replace optical transport and routing equipment throughout the statewide network.
        Our team is excited about the new options and performance improvements this rollout will bring to our members.
        I personally am so excited about this and also the new skills I’ll be developing in my Boston U applications development courses and whatever course work, programs, jobs, or other related opportunities are to follow.
        I have lots of ideas for how to use this at LONI and many other aspects of life. Thank-you for checking out my portfolio.</p>
